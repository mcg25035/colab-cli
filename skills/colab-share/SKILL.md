# Colab Share

Publish a service running inside a private Google Colab runtime as a public demo
URL anyone can open — without the user's machine needing to stay online. Under
the hood it fronts the runtime with a self-refreshing Cloudflare Worker.

## Why this works (read once, it explains the whole design)

Colab's backend serves each `(runtime, port)` at a deterministic, auth-gated URL
`https://<port>-<endpoint>-b.<region>.prod.colab.dev`. Hitting it directly fails:
the edge requires a short-lived `X-Colab-Runtime-Proxy-Token` header (plus
`X-Colab-Client-Agent: vscode`) and rejects mismatched `Origin`.

The Worker is a stable public front that holds the credential and mints/refreshes
that token **at the Cloudflare edge**, then injects the headers and rewrites
`Origin`/`Referer` before proxying. Because the credential lives in the Worker
(not on the user's machine), forwarding keeps working when the laptop is asleep —
until the Colab instance is released, at which point the mint fails and the Worker
serves a friendly "runtime no longer available" page.

Credential chain the Worker runs autonomously:
`refresh_token` → `access_token` (oauth2.googleapis.com) → `runtime-proxy-token`
(colab.pa.googleapis.com, the response carries both the token AND the upstream
url, so the url need not be known ahead of time).

**Model: one Worker = one instance + one port.** When the instance is released,
that Worker is dead weight (it shows the unavailable page); delete it, and create
a fresh one for any new instance/port.

**Edge-side keep-alive (on by default).** Proxying credentials does not stop
Colab from *idle-recycling* the runtime once the local colab-cli daemon stops
heartbeating (e.g. the laptop sleeps). So the Worker also carries a cron trigger
(`*/5 * * * *`) whose `scheduled` handler pings the runtime's keep-alive endpoint
— at the edge, independent of the local machine. It runs only until the
`KEEPALIVE_UNTIL` deadline (default **8h** from publish), then becomes a no-op so
an unused runtime is reclaimed instead of silently burning Colab quota. The ping
reuses the same `refresh_token → access_token` chain as the proxy, so it needs
**no extra bindings**, and since nothing writes the refresh_token back, it cannot
invalidate the local colab-cli login. Tune with `COLAB_WF_KEEPALIVE_HOURS`
(`0` = effectively disabled; deadline lands in the past).

## Prerequisites — check these first

1. **A Cloudflare account (free plan works), with wrangler logged in.** Verify
   `npx wrangler whoami` shows `workers (write)`; otherwise run `npx wrangler
   login`. First deploy registers a free `*.workers.dev` subdomain (the
   `<account-subdomain>` in the URL).
2. **colab-cli is authenticated** and `~/.config/colab-cli/auth.json` exists
   (contains the `refreshToken` the Worker will reuse).
3. **A running Colab runtime** whose service listens on a **free** port.
   ⚠️ Port **8080 is already taken by Colab's internal node process** — the
   user's server must listen on a different free port (e.g. 7860, 8501, 9000).

## Operations

A bundled helper, `scripts/colab-wf.sh`, does the deterministic Cloudflare work.
It takes the `endpoint` explicitly so it stays independent of how colab-cli is
invoked in this environment. Resolve the endpoint yourself, then call it.

### Resolve the endpoint

Run colab-cli's runtime list and read the `endpoint` of the target runtime:

```bash
colab runtime list --json
```

Note on invocation: if a global `colab` fails (e.g. behind an HTTP proxy you'll
see `fetch failed`), run it from the colab-cli repo as
`node --use-env-proxy dist/index.js runtime list --json` (equivalently
`npm start -- runtime list --json`). Use whatever form works in this environment.

### Check for existing forwards before publishing

There's no scripted check for this — judge it case by case, the same way you'd
scan `git status` before a destructive git command. Run `scripts/colab-wf.sh
list` and skim the results for anything that looks like it serves the *same
purpose* as what you're about to publish, not just an exact `port`+`endpoint`
match:

- **Same custom domain.** If the user wants a custom domain (see below), grep
  the recorded projects for it before deploying:
  `grep -l '<domain>' ~/.config/colab-cli/worker-forward/*/wrangler.toml`.
  Cloudflare custom-domain routes are exclusive per zone, so deploying the same
  route on a new Worker silently steals it from whichever Worker held it —
  routing self-heals, but the old Worker is left running as dead weight
  pointing at a route it no longer serves.
- **Same logical service, different endpoint.** A prior session's runtime may
  have died and been replaced (`colab runtime list` won't show it anymore),
  but its Worker — and any custom domain it claimed — is still live on
  Cloudflare, now permanently serving the "runtime no longer available" page.
- **Stale by age.** A `created` timestamp far older than the current session,
  or an `endpoint` absent from `colab runtime list --json`, is a strong signal
  the forward is orphaned.

If you find a match that looks stale or duplicate, don't delete it
unprompted — deleting a Cloudflare Worker is a shared/external-state change.
Tell the user what you found (name, port, endpoint, how old, what makes it
look stale) and ask whether to `rm` it, either before or after publishing the
new one.

### Publish a port

```bash
scripts/colab-wf.sh publish <port> <endpoint>
```

This deterministically: creates a project under
`~/.config/colab-cli/worker-forward/<port>-<endpoint>-<timestamp>/`, writes
`wrangler.toml` (vars: `ENDPOINT`, `PORT`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`,
`KEEPALIVE_UNTIL`; plus a `[triggers]` cron), `wrangler deploy`s a Worker named
`<port>-<endpoint>`, uploads the `REFRESH_TOKEN` secret (read from `auth.json`),
and prints the public URL:

```
https://<port>-<endpoint>.<account-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

Then verify (behind a proxy add `-x "$HTTPS_PROXY"`):

```bash
curl -sS -w '\n[%{http_code}]\n' "$URL/"
```

A `200` with the expected content means it works. A `503` with a "Runtime no
longer available" page means the mint failed (instance gone or auth issue); a
`502` "Service unreachable" page means nothing is listening on that port yet.

### List published forwards

```bash
scripts/colab-wf.sh list
```

Prints the locally-recorded forwards (name, port, endpoint, url, created). These
are local records under `worker-forward/`; a Worker may already be dead if its
instance was released.

### Unpublish (delete the Worker)

```bash
scripts/colab-wf.sh rm <port> <endpoint>
```

Deletes the Cloudflare Worker and removes the local project records.

## Important caveats — surface these to the user

- **Security / blast radius**: the Worker reuses the local colab-cli
  `refresh_token`, which carries the full `colaboratory` OAuth scope (it CANNOT
  touch Drive — that's a separate OAuth client — but it CAN operate any of the
  user's Colab runtimes). It sits as a Cloudflare secret (not public), but anyone
  who obtains that secret gains full Colab control. **Only use this for test
  instances with no sensitive data.** There is no built-in public access control;
  anyone with the URL can reach the service.
- **One Worker per instance+port**; releasing the instance does not auto-delete
  the Worker — it just starts serving the unavailable page. Clean up with `rm`.
  Across repeated publishes (e.g. re-deploying the same demo after a runtime
  died) these accumulate silently since nothing prunes them automatically —
  see "Check for existing forwards before publishing" above.
- **WebSocket** is proxied best-effort (passthrough). Plain HTTP is fully tested.

## Customization knobs (env vars, rarely needed)

- `COLAB_WF_HOME` — where Worker projects are stored (default
  `~/.config/colab-cli/worker-forward`).
- `COLAB_AUTH_FILE` — path to colab-cli auth.json.
- `COLAB_CLIENT_ID` / `COLAB_CLIENT_SECRET` — override the OAuth client.
- `COLAB_WF_COMPAT_DATE` — wrangler `compatibility_date`.
- `COLAB_WF_KEEPALIVE_HOURS` — hours the edge keep-alive cron runs before going
  no-op (default `8`; `0` disables it). Sets the `KEEPALIVE_UNTIL` deadline.

The Worker source is `assets/worker.js` (copied into each project at publish
time). Edit it there to change proxy behavior or the unavailable page.
